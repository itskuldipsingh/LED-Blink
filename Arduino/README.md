# Arduino LED Blinking with Dynamic Frequency
This Arduino project allows you to control the blinking frequency of an LED dynamically through the Serial Monitor.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Arduino board
- USB cable to connect Arduino to your computer
- LED bulb
- 220 ohm resistor

### Setup
1. Connect the LED's anode to the digital pin 13 on the Arduino board through a series resistor and connect the LED's cathode to the ground (GND). 
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch [led_blink_dynamic.ino](https://github.com/itskuldipsingh/LED-Blink/blob/main/Arduino/led_blink_dynamic_frequency.ino) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. 

3. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (`Tools -> Serial Monitor`).
4. Enter a new frequency in the Serial Monitor and press "Enter" to update the LED blinking frequency. 


## Usage
- Enter a new frequency in the Serial Monitor to dynamically change the LED blinking frequency.
