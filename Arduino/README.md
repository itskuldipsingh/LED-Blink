# Arduino LED Blinking with Dynamic Frequency
This Arduino project allows you to control the blinking frequency of an LED dynamically through the Serial Monitor.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Arduino board
- USB cable to connect Arduino to your computer
- LED bulb
- 220 ohm resistor

### Setup
1. Connect the LED's anode to the digital pin 13 on the Arduino board through a series resistor and connect the LED's cathode to the ground (GND). <br> ![image](https://github.com/itskuldipsingh/Arduino/assets/159125809/58ae9d20-022c-4985-a62c-d3907dfc9ba6)
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch [led_blink_dynamic.ino](https://github.com/itskuldipsingh/Arduino/blob/main/Led%20blink/Dynamic%20frequency/led_blink_dynamic_frequency.ino) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. <br> ![image](https://github.com/itskuldipsingh/Arduino/assets/159125809/77fe19e8-1b1d-4701-b219-5dbdbe020110)

3. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (`Tools -> Serial Monitor`).
4. Enter a new frequency in the Serial Monitor and press "Enter" to update the LED blinking frequency. <br> ![image](https://github.com/itskuldipsingh/Arduino/assets/159125809/2c688d06-357d-4cd8-9f5a-0170b2fb5de3)


## Usage
- Enter a new frequency in the Serial Monitor to dynamically change the LED blinking frequency.
